# PredictionTool - Automated Trading Tool for PancakeSwap & CandleGenie

A sophisticated TypeScript-based trading bot that automatically places bets on BNB-USD price predictions across PancakeSwap and CandleGenie platforms. The bot uses intelligent strategies to maximize winning probability by analyzing market sentiment and betting patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dual Platform Support**: Works with both PancakeSwap Prediction V2 and CandleGenie Prediction V3
- **Smart Betting Strategies**: 
  - **Against Strategy**: Bets against the majority when odds are favorable
  - **With Strategy**: Bets with the majority when conditions are optimal
- **Automatic Claiming**: Automatically claims winnings and handles refunds
- **Dynamic Timing**: Adjusts betting timing based on network conditions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live console output with colored status updates
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic retry mechanisms

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- BSC (Binance Smart Chain) wallet with BNB for betting
- Private key for your wallet

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Novus-Tech-LLC/Crypto-Prediction-Tool.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=
   BET_AMOUNT=0.1
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Your wallet's private key | - | ✅ Yes |
| `BET_AMOUNT` | Amount of BNB to bet per round | 0.1 | ❌ No |

### Contract Addresses

- **PancakeSwap Prediction V2**: `0x18B2A687610328590Bc8F2e5fEdDe3b582A49cdA`
- **CandleGenie Prediction V3**: `0x995294CdBfBf7784060BD3Bec05CE38a5F94A0C5`

## 🎯 Usage

### PancakeSwap Predictions

**Against Strategy (Default)**
```bash
npm run start
```

**With Strategy**
```bash
npm run start -- --with
```

### CandleGenie Predictions

**Against Strategy (Default)**

```

**With Strategy**

npm run cg -- --with
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Betting Strategies

1. **Against Strategy**: 
   - Analyzes bull vs bear betting amounts
   - Places bets against the majority when the ratio is favorable (< 5:1)
   - Exploits market inefficiencies and herd behavior

2. **With Strategy**:
   - Bets with the majority when conditions suggest momentum
   - Uses similar ratio analysis but follows the crowd

### Timing Mechanism

- Waits ~281.5 seconds after round start before placing bets
- Dynamically adjusts timing based on network congestion
- Reduces wait time by 6 seconds (2 blocks) if transactions fail

### Automatic Features

- **Claiming**: Automatically claims winnings from previous rounds
- **Refunds**: Handles refunds for invalid rounds
- **Dues**: Sends 2% of winnings to specified address (`0x74b8B9b7aa13D26056F4eceBDF06C917d15974C7`)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Risk Disclaimer
- **This bot involves financial risk**. Only use funds you can afford to lose
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Cryptocurrency trading is highly volatile and unpredictable
- The bot's strategies are based on historical patterns and may not work in all market conditions

### Security Considerations
- Never share your private key
- Use a dedicated wallet for bot trading
- Monitor your bot's performance regularly

### Network Considerations
- The bot uses BSC mainnet by default
- Ensure you have sufficient BNB for gas fees
- Network congestion may affect transaction timing

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small bet amounts to test the bot
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch the bot's performance for the first few rounds
3. **Network Conditions**: Consider network congestion when setting bet amounts
4. **Strategy Selection**: Test both "against" and "with" strategies to see what works best
