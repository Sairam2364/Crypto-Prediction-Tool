## 📋 Prerequisites

- Private key for your wallet

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Novus-Tech-LLC/Crypto-Prediction-Tool.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=
   BET_AMOUNT=0.1
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Your wallet's private key | - | ✅ Yes |
| `BET_AMOUNT` | Amount of BNB to bet per round | 0.1 | ❌ No |

### Contract Addresses

- **PancakeSwap Prediction V2**: `0x18B2A687610328590Bc8F2e5fEdDe3b582A49cdA`
- **CandleGenie Prediction V3**: `0x995294CdBfBf7784060BD3Bec05CE38a5F94A0C5`

## 🎯 Usage

## 🧠 How It Works

### Betting Strategies

1. **Against Strategy**: 
   - Analyzes bull vs bear betting amounts
   - Places bets against the majority when the ratio is favorable (< 5:1)
   - Exploits market inefficiencies and herd behavior

2. **With Strategy**:
   - Bets with the majority when conditions suggest momentum
   - Uses similar ratio analysis but follows the crowd

### Timing Mechanism

- Waits ~281.5 seconds after round start before placing bets
- Dynamically adjusts timing based on network congestion
- Reduces wait time by 6 seconds (2 blocks) if transactions fail

### Automatic Features

- **Claiming**: Automatically claims winnings from previous rounds
- **Refunds**: Handles refunds for invalid rounds
- **Dues**: Sends 2% of winnings to specified address (`0x74b8B9b7aa13D26056F4eceBDF06C917d15974C7`)
